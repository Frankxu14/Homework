To the retailer investors, a robo-advisor purports to be a self-guided online wealth management service that provides automated investment advice at low costs and low account minimums, employing portfolio management algorithms.

## CASE STUDY
### Overview and Origin

One of the most prominent robo-advisors, BETTERMENT, was founded in 2008 by Jon Stein, with his co-founder, a securities lawyer, Eli Broverman.

Initially, robo-advisory technologies were used to manage and automactically balance risk-based portfolio allocation. Robo-advisory technologies, therefore, were not new, but became available and popular in 2008, during the Great Recession. 

According to most recent interview with Bloomberg TV, then 30 Year old founder, Jon Stein, after opening accounts with 7 brokerage firms, and after ups-and-downs in daily trading, realizing the value of simply holding ETFs, and more importantly the appeal of client-centered and technology based, rather than brokerage directed, brokerage services. See Bloomberg article: Betterment CEO Built His Business by Not Watching Stock Market https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2020-07-14/betterment-ceo-jon-stein-on-robo-advising-stocks-and-startups?sref=OV7YsCiJ

The bootstrapping began in 2008, with friends and family funding of $320,000. 

In 2010, founders Stein and Broverman applied to Techcrunch Disrupt New York. In August 2010, a well-placed friend, an attorney named Ed Zimmerman introduced the 2 founders to Rob Stavis, a partner at Bessemer Venture Partners, which assigned a higher valuation than the founders' pitch, and proposed a $3 million round of funding. Bessemer invests $2 million, and about a dozen other investors chip in $1 million.

In October 2012, Menlo announces it will lead a group of investors, including Bessemer, Anthemis Group, and other first-round investors, in a $10 million round of Series B financing in Betterment.

### Scope of Betterment's Business Activities:

The core technology Betterment purports to leverage is computer-algorithm based securities trading advisory, built on the back of ETFs. It aims to solve the issues, first and foremost, clients largely under-served population by traditional, human-based wealth advisors, and secondly, providing an algorithm based adjustments and rebalancing based on client's pre-definded goals and risk preference. 

With advent of AI and machine learning, the industry, and presumably, Betterment, will further develop 
Still, the available technologies, and its business model, would not allow it to abandon the ETFs.

Betterment's intended customers will be mainly the "Facebook generation," and the relatively young, next-generation clients. 
According to Deloitte, estimates for the future Robo-advisory market predict between $2.2 trillion and $3.7 trillion in assets to be managed with the support of Robo-advisory services in 2020. By year 2025 it will rise to over $16.0 trillion assets under management (AUM).

According to its founder Jon Stein, Betterment, with reduced friction, and with best advice thereby removing inertia and fear, and increasing conversion rates, it has a much lower customer acquisition costs (CAC) than industry estimates. However, without full financial disclosure, such as those required in the process of IPO, there is no hard or definitive data. 

Stein and his roommate Sean Owen, a Google software engineer, started building the first online platform for Betterment in 2008 using a Java application and MySQL database on Apache Tomcat servers with an Adobe Flash- and Flex-based front-end design. Initial prototype designs were provided by Stein's then-girlfriend, Polina Khentov. See generally, Wikipedia Article on Betterment.

On the quesiton of which technologies Betterment is currently using--it is not clear,notwithstanding diligent and exhaustive research in this regard.

Presently, the US (and Europen) Robo-advisories employ algorithm-based investment decision making, and automatical portfolio rebalancing. 
With the advent of AI, Machine-learning, the next, major industry trends will be algorithm-based investment by self-learning artificial intelligence (AI), machine-learning technologies.

The other major companies and startups in this domain includes The Vangard Group, Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Wealthfront.

### Industry Impact and Comments

With the launch of the robo-advisory startups, major wealth and asset management firms launched similar, in-house Robo-advisory machines, most by acquisitions.

Betterment's current business model includes three areas of business: retail investment, a platform for advisors, and Betterment for Business is a turnkey 401(k) platform aimed at mid-market employers. Itâ€™s personalized financial advice uses principles-based robo-advisory technologies such as computer algorithms. Licensed financial advisors provide over-the-phone consultations to customers who opt for additional support. 

As of March 2020 it has AUM $22 billion (USD), with an estimated market capialization worth about $800 million. As an independent, 10 Year startup, it is fast-growing and performing relatively well relative to competitors.

## Comments and Advices

If I were to advise the company, I would recommend that it invests on AI and Machine Learning (ML) technologies, to make it possible to offer an AI-based, self-learning trading algorithm, for a select group of clients who prefer a high-risk, high-return investment strategy.

AI-based, self-learning trading algorithm will become one of the core-competency, in the face of the increasing competition, and benefit the Company and effectively differentiate itself with other robo-advisory funds.
